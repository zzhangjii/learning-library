## Overview

Oracle Functions is a fully managed, highly scalable, on-demand, Functions-as-a-Service platform, built on enterprise-grade Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and powered by the Fn Project open source engine. Use Oracle Functions (sometimes abbreviated to just Functions) when you want to focus on writing code to meet business needs. You don't have to worry about the underlying infrastructure because Oracle Functions will ensure your app is highly-available, scalable, secure, and monitored. With Oracle Functions, you can deploy your code, call it directly or trigger it in response to events, and get billed only for the resources consumed during the execution.

```
docker version
```
TO verify docker version

```
$ docker run hello-world
```
To launch the standard hello-world Docker image as a container

17. Next we will install Fn CLI which is needed to execute CLI commands. Enter command;
```
curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install | sh
```

18. Confirm that the CLI has been installed. Enter command;
```
fn version
```

19. Next create the new Fn Project CLI context. Enter command;
```
 fn create context <CONTEXT NAME> --provider oracle
```

20. Specify that the Fn Project CLI is to use the new context. Enter command;
```
fn use context <CONTEXT NAME>
```

21. Switch to OCI Cosole. From OCI Services Meneu, Click **Compartments** under **Identity**. 

22. Locate your compartment and click the name. Copy the OCID of the compartment just as was done for User and Tenancy. Also note down youe region name

23. Switch back to ssh session to compute instance. Configure the new context with the OCID of the compartment you want to own deployed functions. Enter Command;

```
fn update context oracle.compartment-id <compartment-ocid>
```


24. Configure the new context with the api-url endpoint to use when calling the OCI API. Enter command;

```
fn update context api-url https://functions.us-<REGION NAME>.oraclecloud.com
```

**For example: fn update context api-url https://functions.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com**


25. Configure the new context with the address of the Docker registry and repository that you want to use with Oracle Functions, Enter command;
```
fn update context registry <region-code>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>
```

where <region-code> indicates the registry location. Region codes are list at https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Registry/Concepts/registryprerequisites.htm#regional-availability, and <tenancy-namespace> is the tenancy's name string shown on the Tenancy Information page.

***For example: fn update context registry phx.ocir.io/ansh81vru1zp/acme-repo** (Here region code is phx, tenancy name is ansh81vru1zp and acme-repo is docker registry repo which will be used for Function)

26. Configure the new context with the name of the profile you've created for use with Oracle Functions. Enter command;
```
fn update context oracle.profile DEFAULT
```

27. Next we will login to OCI Registry and ensure we have access. Enter command;
```
docker login <region-code>.ocir.io
```

**For example: docker login iad.ocir.io**

28. When prompted, enter your user name in the format <tenancy-namespace>/<username>.
**For example: ansh81vru1zp/jdoe@acme.com**
 
29. When prompted for a password, enter the auth token generated ealier.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Configuring_Fn/img/Fn_001.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

30. Next we will create our fist applicaiton. Login to OCI console. Under OCI serverices menu, click  **Solutions and Platform**, click **Developer Services** and then **Functions**

31. Click **Create Application** and fill out the dialog box:

- **NAME**: Provide a name (note down the name)
- **VCN in** : Choose the compartment where VCN was created
- **SUBNETS** : Choose one of the subnet
- **LOGGING POLICY**: None

Click **Create**

32. Next we will create our first function. In the ssh session to compute instance, Enter command;
```
fn init --runtime java <FUNCTION_NAME>
```
A directory called <FUNCTION_NAME>-func is created, containing:

a function definition file called func.yaml
a /src directory containing source files and directories for the <FUNCTION_NAME> function
a Maven configuration file called pom.xml that specifies the dependencies required to compile the function

33. Next we will deploy the function. Change directory to the <FUNCTION_NAME> directory created in the previous step
```
cd <FUNCTION_NAME>-func
```

34. Enter the following single Fn Project command to build the function and its dependencies as a Docker image called <FUNCTION_NAME>, push the image to the specified Docker registry, and deploy the function to Oracle Functions in the <NAME> used when **Create Application** was used. Enter command;
```
fn deploy --app <NAME>
```

**NOTE: <FUNCTION_NAME> is what was used in the compute instance and <NAME> is what was used in OCI Console**

35. You can also Confirm that the <FUNCTION_NAME> image has been pushed to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry by logging in to the Console. Under **Solutions and Platform**, go to **Developer Services** and click **Registry**. 

36.  Now lets Invoke your first function. In the ssh session to compute instance, Enter command;
```
fn invoke <NAME> <FUNCTION_NAME>-func
```
**For exampel if in OCI console we used *helloworld-app* as the name and in compute instance we use *helloworld* then the command will be 'fn invoke helloworld-app helloworld-func'**

37. Verify 'Hello World !' message is displayed.

Congratulations! You've just created, deployed, and invoked your first function using Oracle Functions!
