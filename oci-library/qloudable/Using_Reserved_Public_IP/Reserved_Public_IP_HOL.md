## Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Reserved Public IP service is an internet-scale, high-performance storage platform that offers reliable and cost-efficient data durability. The Reserved Public IP service can store an unlimited amount of unstructured data of any content type, including analytic data and rich content, like images and videos.

With Reserved Public IP, you can safely and securely store or retrieve data directly from the internet or from within the cloud platform. Reserved Public IP offers multiple management interfaces that let you easily manage storage at scale.

Reserved Public IP is a regional service and is not tied to any specific compute instance. You can access data from anywhere inside or outside the context of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

The purpose of this lab is to give you an overview of the Reserved Public IP Service and an example scenario to help you understand how the service works.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL008.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 

```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```

and then 

```
ls 
```

to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  

```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

, highlight the key and copy

16. Note down the Public IP address.

***We have successfully assigned a Reserved Public IP address to the compute instance***

In git-bash Enter Command:
```
 cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
```
17. Enter **ls** and verify id_rsa file exists

18. Enter command: **Make sure to use the Reserved Public IP that we assigned to the compute instane**
```
ssh -i id_rsa_user opc@<RESERVED_PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>

20. Verify opc@<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME> appears on the prompt

***We successfully ssh into the compute instance using the reserved public IP. Next we will use the same Public IP and assign it to a different Compute instance***

## Un assign Reserved Public IP and assign it to a new compute instance

1. Navigate to VNIC details page in OCI console window. Click **IP Addresses**, then **Edit** under the Action icon

2. In the dialog box under Public IP Address choose **NO PUBLIC IP** (Note the Warning message indicating
Reserved Public IP will be unassigned) . Click **Update**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Using_Reserved_Public_IP/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0027.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

**Reserved Public IP has now been un-assigned from this compute instance. Next we will create a new compute instance and assign this same Public IP to it.**

3. Create a second compute instance following same steps as for the first compute instnae. **Make sure to not assign a Public IP to this compute either**

4. Following same steps as earlier Edit the VNIC information for this compute instance and assign it the same Reserved Public IP that we created.

5. Following same steps as earlier, ssh to the second compute instance using the Reserved Public IP address.

6. Verify you logged into the second compute instance.

**This demonstrated how to use Reserved IP address functionality in OCI to access different compute instances**

## Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click Instances under Compute

3. Locate first compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminate**

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

5. Repeat the step to delete the scond compute instance

6. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will 
appear.

7. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted
