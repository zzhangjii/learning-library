## Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud. Use Container Engine for Kubernetes (sometimes abbreviated to just OKE) when your development team wants to reliably build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications. You specify the compute resources that your applications require, and Container Engine for Kubernetes provisions them on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in an existing OCI tenancy.

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist.

```
cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

21. Highligh and copy the content from ssh session. Switch to OCI Console, Click Human icon followed by your user name. In user details page Click **Add Public Key**. In the dialg box paste the public key content and Click **Add**.

1. Switch to git-bash window, Enter commands:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube 
```
```
cd $HOME/.kube

3. Enter command ls and verify a file named **config** exists.

We have initialized the enviornment.

## Starting the Kubernetes Dashboard

In this section we will start Kubernetes Dashboard which is
a web-based user interface that you can use as an alternative
to the Kubernetes kubectl command line tool

1. Switch to OCI Console window. From services menu, Click **Container Clusters(OKE)** under **Developer services**.

2. Click your cluster name and verify Compute Node State shows active for all compute nodes

3. Click **Getting Started** and Copy the URL under Getting Started

## Deploying a Sample Nginx App on Cluster Using kubectl

1. In git bash window, change Directory to $HOME/.kube, Enter Command:
```
cd $HOME/.kube
```

2. Create nginx deployment with three replicas,  Enter Command:
``` 
./kubectl run nginx  --image=nginx --port=80 --replicas=3
```

3. Get Deployment data, Enter Command:
``` 
./kubectl get deployments
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OKE/img/OKE_010.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

5.  Create a service to expose the application. The cluster is integrated with the OCI Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). As a result, creating a service of type --type=LoadBalancer will expose the pods to the Internet using an OCI Load Balancer.In git-bash window Enter command:
```
./kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

6. Switch to OCI console window. From OCI Services menu Click **Load Balancers** under Networking. A new OCI LB should be getting  provisioned (This is due to the command above). 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OKE/img/OKE_011.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

7. Once Load Balancer is Active, Click Load Balancer name and from Load Balancer details page note down its IP address.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OKE/img/OKE_012.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

8. open a new browser tab and enter URL  http://<Load-Balancer-Public-IP> (http://129.213.76.26 in this example). Nginx Welcome screen should be displayed
