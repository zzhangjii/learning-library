## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Storage (File System) self-paced lab from Oracle!

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage Service provides a durable, scalable, distributed, enterprise-grade network file system. You can connect to a File Storage Service file system from any bare metal, virtual machine, or container instance in your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). You can also access a file system from outside the VCN using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect and Internet Protocol security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN).

In this lab you will create and mount File Storage System to a compute instance and verify availability of the File Storage system.

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
 , highlight the key and copy

10. Wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. In git-bash Enter Command:
```
 cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
```
11. Enter **ls** and verify id_rsa file exists

12. Enter command 
```
ssh -i id_rsa_user opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
```

**HINT:** If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command. You MUST type the command, do NOT copy and paste ssh command

13. Enter 'Yes' when prompted for security message

14. Verify opc@<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME> appears on the prompt

## Mount the File Storage System to Compute Instance

Users of Ubuntu and Linux operating systems (We launched a Oracle Linux instance) can use the command line to connect to a file system and write files. Mount targets serve as file system network access points. After your mount target is assigned an IP address, you can use it to mount the file system. You need to install an NFS client and create a mount point. When you mount the file system, the mount point effectively represents the root directory of the File Storage file system, allowing you to write files to the file system from the instance.

1. In ssh session to Compute instance Enter command:
``` 
sudo yum install nfs-utils 
```
to install nfs-utils. 

**NOTE:** Type ‘y’ if prompted for ‘Is this OK’

2. Enter command:
```
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs-data 
```
to create a mount point.

3. Mount the file system, Enter command: 
```
sudo mount 10.x.x.x:/ /mnt/nfs-data 
```
**NOTE:** The 10.x.x.x should be replaced with the Private IP of File Storage system noted earlier (Example: sudo mount 10.0.0.3:/ /mnt/nfs-data).

**NOTE:** Mount commands can also be see by clicking Action icon  in File Storage detail page though 'localpath' in sudo mkdir and sudo mount MUST be replaced by the directory created (nfs-data).

 4. Enter command:
```
df -h OR mount | grep /mnt/nfs-data
```
and verify the mounted File System Storage.

5. If you want to ping the mount point then modify the security list of the VCN for Ingress ICMP rule:
- Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
- IP Protocol: ICMP
- Source port range: All
- Destination port range: All

6. **Optional Step**. Second compute instance can be created and same file system mounted on it following earlier steps
             
**You have now mounted Enterprise grade File System storage created in OCI to your compute instance. You can place files in this file system and all other VM instances that have mounted the same file system will have access to it.**
