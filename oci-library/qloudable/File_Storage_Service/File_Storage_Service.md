## Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Storage (File System) self-paced lab from Oracle!

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage Service provides a durable, scalable, distributed, enterprise-grade network file system. You can connect to a File Storage Service file system from any bare metal, virtual machine, or container instance in your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). You can also access a file system from outside the VCN using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect and Internet Protocol security (IPSec) virtual private network (VPN).

In this lab you will create and mount File Storage System to a compute instance and verify availability of the File Storage system.

**We now have a File Storage system created. Next we will create a SSH key pair that will be used to login to a compute instance and mount the file system.**

## Create ssh keys and compute instance

1. Click the Apps icon in the toolbar and select  Git-Bash to open a terminal window.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL006.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

2. Enter command 
```
ssh-keygen
```
**HINT:** You can swap between OCI window, 
git-bash sessions and any other application (Notepad, etc.) by Clicking the Switch Window icon 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL008.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
 , highlight the key and copy

- **Assign a public IP address**: Check this option

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0011.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

- **Boot Volume:** Leave the default
- **Add SSH Keys:** Choose 'Paste SSH Keys' and paste the Public Key saved earlier.

9. Click **Create**

**NOTE:** If 'Service limit' error is displayed choose a different shape from VM.Standard2.1, VM.Standard.E2.1, VM.Standard1.1, VM.Standard.B1.1  OR choose a different AD


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0011.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

10. Wait for Instance to be in **Running** state. In git-bash Enter Command:
```
 cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh
```
11. Enter **ls** and verify id_rsa file exists

12. Enter command 
```
ssh -i id_rsa opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
```

**HINT:** If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command. You MUST type the command, do NOT copy and paste ssh command

13. Enter 'Yes' when prompted for security message

14. Verify opc@<COMPUTE_INSTANCE_NAME> appears on the prompt

## Mount the File Storage System to Compute Instance

Users of Ubuntu and Linux operating systems (We launched a Oracle Linux instance) can use the command line to connect to a file system and write files. Mount targets serve as file system network access points. After your mount target is assigned an IP address, you can use it to mount the file system. You need to install an NFS client and create a mount point. When you mount the file system, the mount point effectively represents the root directory of the File Storage file system, allowing you to write files to the file system from the instance.

1. In ssh session to Compute instance Enter command: 
``` 
sudo yum install nfs-utils 
```
(This is just to ensure nfs-utils is installed)


2. Enter command:
```
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs-data 
```
to create a mount point.

3. Mount the file system, Enter command: 
```
sudo mount 10.x.x.x:/<EXPORT_PATH_NAME> /mnt/nfs-data
```
**NOTE:** The 10.x.x.x should be replaced with the  IP of File Storage system  and <EXPORT_PATH_NAME> should be replaced with Export path name used earlier(Example: If '/' was the EXPORT_PATH_NAME then **sudo mount 10.0.0.3:/ /mnt/nfs-data**).

**NOTE:** Mount commands can also be seen by Clicking Action icon in File Storage detail, and selecting ‘Mount Commands’


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/File_Storage_Service/img/FSS_006.png" alt="image-alt-text">

 4. Enter command:
```
df -h OR mount | grep /mnt/nfs-data
```
and verify the mounted File System Storage.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/File_Storage_Service/img/FSS_008.png" alt="image-alt-text">

5. If you want to ping the mount point then modify the security list of the VCN for Ingress ICMP rule:


- Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
- IP Protocol: ICMP
- Source port range: All
- Destination port range: All

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/File_Storage_Service/img/FSS_009.png" alt="image-alt-text">

6. **Optional Step**. Second compute instance can be created and same file system mounted on it following earlier steps
             
**You have now mounted Enterprise grade File System storage created in OCI to your compute instance. You can place files in this file system and all other VM instances that have mounted the same file system will have access to it.**

## Delete the resources
