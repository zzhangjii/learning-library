## Overview

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notifications service broadcasts messages  to distributed components through a publish-subscribe pattern, delivering secure, highly reliable, low latency and durable messages for applications hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and externally.
The Notifications service enables you to set up communication channels for publishing messages using topics  and subscriptions . When a message is published to a topic, the Notifications service sends the message to all of the topic's subscriptions.
In this lab we will verify notifications when a compute instance is launched and deleted

**Some Key points;**

**We recommend using Chrome or Edge as the broswer. Also set your browser zoom to 80%**


- All screen shots are examples ONLY. Screen shots can be enlarged by Clicking on them

- Login credentials are provided later in the guide (scroll down). Every User MUST keep these credentials handy.

- Do NOT use compartment name and other data from screen shots.Only use  data(including compartment name) provided in the content section of the lab

- Mac OS Users should use ctrl+C / ctrl+V to copy and paste inside the OCI Console

- Login credentials are provided later in the guide (scroll down). Every User MUST keep these credentials handy.

**Cloud Tenant Name**
**User Name**
**Password**
**Compartment Name (Provided Later)**

**Note:** OCI UI is being updated thus some screenshots in the instructions might be different than actual UI

2. First we will create a Notification topic and subscribe to this topic. From OCI Services menu,Click **Notifications** under **Application Integration**

3. Click **Create Topic** and fill out the dialog box:

- **Name**: Provide a name
- **Description**: Provide a description

3. Click **Create**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Using_Events_and_Notification/img/Events_001.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

- **PROTOCOL**: Email
- **EMAIL**: Provide your email id

5. Click **Create**

6. Subscription details screen will be displayed with subscription status showig **Pending**.

7. Check the email account you specifed and click the verification link for this subscription. Switch back to OCI console window and verify the subscription status chanegd to **Active**

8. You are now subsribed to a Notification topic. Next we will configure Events that will publish messages to this Notification topic.

9. From OCI Services menu,Click **Event Service** under **Application Integration**

10. Click **Create Rule**, Fill out the dialog box:

- **DISPLAY NAME** : Provide a name
- **DESCRIPTION** : Provide a description

Under **Rule Conditions**

- Ensure **Event Type** is selected
- **SERVICE NAME**: Compute
- **EVENT TYPE** : Choose these 4 Types from the drop down menu. **Instance-Launch Begin**, **Instance-Launch End**, **Instance-Terminate Begin**, **Instance-Terminate End**

Under **Actions**

- **ACTION TYPE**: Notifications
- **NOTIFICATIONS COMPARTMENT**: Choose your compartment 
- **TOPIC**: Choose the topic created earlier

11. Click **Create Rule**

**We have now configured Notification service and tied events to it with a specific compartment. When a new compute instance is launched or terminated an email notification will be sent to the email address specified**

## Create VCN 

1. From the OCI Services menu,Click **Virtual Cloud Network**. Select the compartment assigned to you from drop down menu on left part of the screen under Networking and Click **Networking QuickStart**

**NOTE:** Ensure the correct Compartment is selected under COMPARTMENT list


2. Click **VCN with Internet Connectivity** and click **Start Workflow**

3. Fill out the dialog box:


- **VCN NAME**: Provide a name
- **COMPARTMENT**: Ensure your compartment is selected
- **VCN CIDR BLOCK**: Provide a CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16)
- **PUBLIC SUBNET CIDR BLOCK**: Provide a CIDR block (10.0.1.0/24)
- **PRIVATE SUBNET CIDR BLOCK**: Provide a CIDR block (10.0.2.0/24)
- Click **Next**

4. Verify all the information and  Click **Create**

5. This will create a VCN with followig components.

**VCN**, **Public subnet**, **Private subnet**, **Internet gateway (IG)**, **NAT gateway (NAT)**, **Service gateway (SG)**

6. Click **View Virtual Cloud Network** to display your VCN details.

              
## Create compute instance and verify notification

1. From OCI services menu, Click **Instances** under **Compute** 

2. Click **Create Instance**. Fill out the dialog box:

- **Name your instance**: Enter a name 
- **Choose an operating system or image source**: For the image, we recommend using the Latest Oracle Linux available.
