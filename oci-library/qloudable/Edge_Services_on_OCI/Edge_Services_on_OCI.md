## Overview

OCI DNS has advanced traffic management capabilities to steer DNS traffic across multiple public OCI instances and other private and 3rd party assets/endpoints. Traffic management supports comprehensive policies to provide intelligent responses to ensure high performance, scalability, and availability.

In this lab, we will learn how to use OCI DNS Traffic Management service to ensure high availability of your web applications through detection of endpoint health and diverting your traffic accordingly

```
sudo yum -y install httpd 
```
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent  --add-port=80/tcp 
```
(Open port 80 on the firewall to allow http and https traffic).

**NOTE:** --add-port flag has no spaces.

sudo firewall-cmd --reload 
```
(Reload the firewall to activate the rules).

```
sudo systemctl start httpd 
```
(Start the web server).

```
sudo su 
```

echo 'WebServer1' >>/var/www/html/index.html 
```
(create index.html file. The content of the file will be displayed when the web server is accessed.)

18. Bring up the SSH session for the second Compute instance and repeat commands:(Install Apache HTTP Server)

```
sudo yum -y install httpd 
```
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent  --add-port=80/tcp 
```
(Open port 80 on the firewall to allow http and https traffic).

**NOTE:** --add-port flag has no spaces.

sudo systemctl start httpd 
```
(Start the web server).

```
sudo su 
```
(Change user privilege)

```
echo 'WebServer2' >>/var/www/html/index.html 
```
(create index.html file. The content of the file will be displayed when the web server is accessed.)

19. Switch back to OCI Console window.

We now have two Compute instances with Web servers installed and a basis index.html file. 

**Note down the Public IP addresses of both compute**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Edge_Services_on_OCI/img/DNS_007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

5. Once the health check runs after the interval specified in health check (30 seconds), the health status will update to show status of your webservers.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Edge_Services_on_OCI/img/DNS_008.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

6. Launch a new browser tab, open up the domain specified in your traffic policy(for webserver1) and you will be directed to the webserver1

**http://<YOUR_USER_NAME>Ocispl24.com**

**NOTE : <YOUR_USER_NAME> is what was specified as the sub domain**

7. You should see 'Webserver1' displayed in the browser window

## Failover Test for Traffic Management Policy

We will now do a failover test of the policy just created. We will STOP Webserver1 and test if the healt check is updated, and the traffic is diverted to webserver2.

1. Switch to OCI Console window and navigate to **Compute** under **Instances**

2. Click on first compute (weberver1) name to display compute details page

3. Click **Stop** to stop the first compute instance (webserver1)

4. In the **overview** section of the details page of your traffic policy, Click **Update Health Status**. It will show webserver1(first compute) is currently unhealthy. And as per the policy priority pools, the traffic will be directed to the webserver2 (compute2).
