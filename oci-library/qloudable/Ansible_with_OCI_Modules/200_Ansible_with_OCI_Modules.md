## Overview

Today, the **Infrastructure as Code** paradigm is a norm for DevOps professionals, and Ansible is one of the leading tools that enables this paradigm. Ansible is great; not just for configuration management, but also for infrastructure provisioning and orchestration. And yet, have you ever wondered how to really use Ansible to manage your cloud infrastructure at scale?

This lab will demonstration both provisioning and configuration of your infrastructure. You will first provision a set of infrastructure resources with a single Ansible playbook.  Next, you will leverage Ansible's *Dynamic Inventory* functionality to fetch the details of this infrastructure and install use those details to deploy Apache (the configuration management aspect).   You would be doing all of it using your Ansible playbooks, leveraging the ‘Infrastructure as code’ paradigm.

20. **oci setup config** also generated an API key. We will need to upload this API key into our OCI account for authentication of API calls. Switch to ssh session to compute instance, to display the conent of API key Enter command :
```
cat ~/.oci/oci_api_key_public.pem
```

21. Highlight and copy the content from ssh session. Switch to OCI Console, Click Human icon followe by your user name. In user details page Click **Add Public Key**. In the dialg box paste the public key content and Click **Add**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Deploying_OCI_Streaming_service/img/Stream_007.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

22. Navigate to ``Identity`` --> ``Compartments`` and locate the OCID for your assigned compartment.  Copy it.

23. Return to your SSH terminal session.  To validate that the CLI is working properly run the following command.
```
oci compute instance list --compartment-id <value you copied in previous step>
```

## Getting started with Ansible
In this section we will download some sample Ansible resources and configure it to work with our OCI tenancy.  Before starting this section, make sure you are in your SSH connection to the server you created in the previous section.

1. Create an SSH key that Ansible will use when deploying new compute resources.  Press enter repeatedly to accept all default.
```
ssh-keygen
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Ansible_with_OCI_Modules/img/ansible_002.png" alt="image-alt-text">

2. Download and unzip the sample files.
```
wget https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/raw/master/oci-library/qloudable/Ansible_with_OCI_Modules/files/oci_ansible.zip
unzip oci_ansible.zip
```

3. Ansible will use your CLI credentials to authenticate and authorize access to OCI.  You will need to configure details of which Compartment to use and which Compute image.  Modify the **env-vars** file to update these values.
```
# OCID of assigned compartment
export compartment_ocid=[your compartment id goes here - without square brackets]
# Oracle-Linux-7.7-2019.08-28-0
#Ashburn
export image_ocid=ocid1.image.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaayuihpsm2nfkxztdkottbjtfjqhgod7hfuirt2rqlewxrmdlgg75q
#Phoenix
export image_ocid=ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaadtmpmfm77czi5ghi5zh7uvkguu6dsecsg7kuo3eigc5663und4za
# skip host verification prompts for demo
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
```

**NOTE:** You should only need to modify the compartment OCID.  If running in Phoenix instead of Ashburn, just move the **#** to comment out the line for the region you are not using.

4. Save and exit the file.
5. Load the variables in the above file into ENV
```
source env_vars
```

6. You will also need to update the ``oci_inventory.ini`` file for the dynamic inventory script.  Uncomment the compartment setting and replace the value with your compartment ocid.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Ansible_with_OCI_Modules/img/ansible_004.png" alt="image-alt-text">

7. Run the first sample playbook.  This will list some information about any compute resources you have in the compartment (should be the one you are using right now).
```
ansible-playbook sample.yaml
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Ansible_with_OCI_Modules/img/ansible_001.jpg" alt="image-alt-text">

8. If the output is devoid of errors, it is time to deploy our sample infrastructure.
```
ansible-playbook instance_pool_example.yaml
```

**NOTE:** This will take about 5 minutes to provision the network and compute resources.  You can navigate to *Instance Pools* in the OCI Management Console to watch the resources if you'd like.  

9. When the playbook execution is complete, see the output near the end for the public IP address of the instance that was provisioned.  Copy the IP address.

10. Open a new tab in the web browser and paste in the IP address; press enter.  You should encounter an error because nothing has been installed on the server yet.  Proceed to the next section.


## Deploying applications and code with Ansible
Now that we have provisioned our infrastructure, it is time to deploy an application (Apache) and some code (a simple HTML page).

1. Return to your SSH terminal session.

2. Run the following command to deploy and configure Apache on each server in the instance pool.
```
ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=./oci_inventory.py ansible-playbook -u opc --become provision_web_server.yaml
```

3. After this completes (about 10 seconds) return to your web browser and refresh the sample web server page from earlier.  It should now display *Configured by Ansible*.

**Challenge**
In this tutorial, Ansible is deploying a simple HTML page.  You can make modifications to the page and run the command in step 2 to deploy the "new code".

When finished, refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Cleaning up your environment
In this exercise, all of the resources provisioned by Ansible were also tagged.  The sample ``teardown.yaml`` script leverages these tags to find and destroy all the resources that were created.

1. Run the following command to remove all the resources.
```
ansible-playbook teardown.yaml
```

2. It should take 3-5 minutes to complete.

3. You did it!  Feel free to explore the code or repeat the steps above once more if you have time.

***Congratulations! You have successfully completed Getting Started with OCI CLI lab.***
