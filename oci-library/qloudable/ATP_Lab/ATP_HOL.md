## Overview

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Autonomous Transaction Processing Cloud Service is a fully managed, preconfigured database environment. You do not need to configure or manage any hardware, or install any software. After provisioning, you can scale the number of CPU cores or the storage capacity of the database at any time without impacting availability or performance. Autonomous Transaction Processing handles creating the database, as well as the following maintenance tasks:


- Backing up the database
- Patching the database
- Upgrading the database
