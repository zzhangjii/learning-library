## Overview

In this lab we will create a compute instance, instance configuration and then configure auto scaling. We will then verify auto scaling feature as configured threshold on CPU are crossed.
Autoscaling enables you to automatically adjust the number of Compute instances in an instance pool based on performance metrics such as CPU utilization. This helps you provide consistent performance for your end users during periods of high demand, and helps you reduce your costs during periods of low demand.

You select a performance metric to monitor, and set thresholds that the performance metric must reach to trigger an autoscaling event. When system usage meets a threshold, autoscaling dynamically allocates resources in near-real time. As load increases, instances are automatically provisioned: the instance pool scales out. As load decreases, instances are automatically removed: the instance pool scales in.

Autoscaling relies on performance metrics that are collected by the Monitoring service. These performance metrics are aggregated into one-minute time periods and then averaged across the instance pool. When three consecutive values (that is, the average metrics for three consecutive minutes) meet the threshold, an autoscaling event is triggered.

A cooldown period between autoscaling events lets the system stabilize at the updated level. The cooldown period starts when the instance pool reaches a steady state. Autoscaling continues to evaluate performance metrics during the cooldown period. When the cooldown period ends, autoscaling adjusts the instance pool's size again if needed.

## Configure instance pool and auto scaling

1. Configure instance pool requires creating a instance configuration. First we will create ssh keys and a compute instance to create instance configuration. 
Click the Apps icon in the toolbar and select  Git-Bash to open a terminal window.

2. Enter command 
```
ssh-keygen
```
**HINT:** You can swap between OCI window, 
git-bash sessions and any other application (Notepad, etc.) by clicking the Switch Window icon

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command  
```
cat /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
 , highlight the key and copy

**We have now created a auto scaling policy that will start with creating 1 compute instnace in the designated pool. Once the CPU utilization is determined to be above 10% for atleast 300 seconds another compute instance will be launched automatically. Once the CPU utilization is determined to be less than 5% for 300 seconds, one compute instance will be removed. At all times there will be atleast 1 compute instance in the pool**

**Original image can be deleted as it's not part of the pool**

19. Click **Instance Pools** under **Compute** and then your pool name. You should see a Compute instance created. Click the Compute Instance name.

20. Note down the Publci IP of compute instnace from the details page (Under **Primary VNIC Information** section). Switch to git bash window, if the ssh session to compute instance is still open then exit out of the session (quit command). 

21. Ensure you are in /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh directory.

22. Enter **ls** and verify id_rsa file exists

23. Enter command 
```
ssh -i id_rsa_user opc@<PUBLIC_IP_OF_COMPUTE>
```

**HINT:** If 'Permission denied error' is seen, ensure you are using '-i' in the ssh command

24. Enter 'Yes' when prompted for security message

25. We will now install a tool called stress to trigger CPU load. In ssh session to compute instance, Enter command:

```
sudo yum -y install stress
```

26. Now start CPU stress, Enter command:

```
sudo stress --cpu 4 --timeout 350
```

***spawn 4 workers spinning on sqrt() with a timeout of 350 seconds.***

27. Switch back to OCI console and navigate to Instance pool details page. Click your instance name and scroll down to **Metric** screen, you should see CPU spiking up after a minute or so.

28. Navigate to your Instance Pool details page. In about 3-4 minutes (time configured when we created auto scale configuration), status of Pool should change to **Scaling** and a second compute instance should launch.

**This is since our criteria of CPU utilization > 10 was met**

29. Switch back to git bash window and if the stress tool is still running, Pree Ctrl + C to stop the script.

30. Switch back to OCI console window and navigate to your compute instance details page. Verify CPU utilization goes down after a minute.

31. Navigate to Instanse pool details page and after 3-4 minute Instance pool status will change to **Scaling** . Additional compute instance will be deleted. 

**This is becuase our criteria of CPU utilization < 5 is met**

## Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. From Instance Pool Details page, Click **Terminate** under **Action**. Provide Instance Pool name in the pop up dialog box and click **Terminate**. This will delete the pool along with the compute instance and auto scale configuration.

4. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will 
appear.

5. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted
