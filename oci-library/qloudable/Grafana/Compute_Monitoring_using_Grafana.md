## Overview

Grafana is an open source visualization tool that can be used on top of a variety of different data stores

Essentially, it’s a feature-rich replacement for Graphite-web, which helps users to easily create and edit dashboards. It contains a unique Graphite target parser that enables easy metric and function editing. Users can create comprehensive charts with smart axis formats (such as lines and points) as a result of Grafana’s fast, client-side rendering — even over long ranges of time — that uses Flot as a default option.

**Some Key points;**

**We recommend using Chrome or Edge as the broswer. Also set your browser zoom to 80%**


- All screen shots are examples ONLY. Screen shots can be enlarged by Clicking on them

- Login credentials are provided later in the guide (scroll down). Every User MUST keep these credentials handy.

- Do NOT use compartment name and other data from screen shots.Only use  data(including compartment name) provided in the content section of the lab

4. You should now have the Public and Private keys:

/C/Users/ PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)

/C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

**NOTE:** id_rsa.pub will be used to create 
Compute instance and id_rsa to connect via SSH into compute instance.

**HINT:** Enter command 
```
cd /C/Users/PhotonUser/.ssh (No Spaces) 
```
and then 
```
ls 
```
to verify the two files exist. 

5. In git-bash Enter command

## Install Grafana and stress tool on compute instance

**As part of preperation for this lab, a dynamic group and IAM policy was created. This configuration enables Grafana based monitoring on the compute instance. Below 2 policy statements are already configured though for any new deployment they must be configured under IAM Policy.**

**allow group <GROUP_NAME> to read metrics in tenancy**

**allow group <GROUP_NAME> to read compartments in tenancy**

1. Switch to ssh session to compute install. Install Grafana, Enter Command:
```
sudo yum install https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana-5.4.2-1.x86_64.rpm -y
```

18. Save the dashboard by clicking the save icon (disk icon). 

19. Switch to ssh session to compute instance and install tool called **stress**. We will use this tool to stress the CPU and Memory of the compute instance. Enter Command:
```
sudo yum install stress
```

20. Now generate traffic, Enter Command:

```
sudo stress --cpu 5 --io 12 --vm 5 --vm-bytes 256M --timeout 600s
```

**We now have  completed our setup with a compute instance and installed and executed a tool to stress the CPU and Memory. Next we will monitor  Grafana dash board for this compute instance**

## Adjust Parameters in Grafana dashboard

1. Switch to Grafana dash board, you should observe the CPU utilization and Memory utilization grpah changing. You can adjust parameters such as Time period and refresh rate as shown below

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/Grafana/img/Grafana_014.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

**We have now completed Grafana setup and can monitor the utilization of parameters on the compute instance. Next we will delete the resources we created**

## Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**

3. Locate compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminate** 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0016.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

4. Make sure Permanently delete the attached Boot Volume is checked, Click Terminate Instance. Wait for instance to fully Terminate

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_Quick_Start/img/RESERVEDIP_HOL0017.PNG" alt="image-alt-text">

5. From OCI services menu Click **Virtual Cloud Networks** under Networking, list of all VCNs will 
appear.

6. Locate your VCN , Click Action icon and then **Terminate**. Click **Delete All** in the Confirmation window. Click **Close** once VCN is deleted
