Email for Login & Link to Cloud My Services

1.  After sign up for the free Oracle Cloud promotion or a paid account, or as with this lab, 
    you’ll get an email. The email indicates your account is ready or provides
    you with cloud account details and sign in credentials dependent upon how its been setup by the Cloud Administrator.

2.  Typically for customers, they will scroll down in their email invitation to the Access Details section and note user name           and password. 

3.  Its essential to note the name of the Cloud Account, Access Details, and Identity
    Domain.

4.  Then click Access your Cloud Services to get started. 
Note that for internal use, the Cloud Administrator may not setup access that way and you enter the specific environment you've been instructed to use and then your SSO credentials. 

5.  And a best practices to bookmark it before sign-in.
