# Welcome to the OCI Level 100 Hands On Labs

Here are 14 labs that will cover some of the basic concepts of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.  These labs will help establish a base for more advanced concepts.  

Choose a lab from the menu on the right.  The menu progresses in a basic order of compute, networking, storage, autonomous database, identity, and various services beyond that.  Proceed down the list or do the labs that interest you most.   Each lab is self-contained so they do not have to be performed in any specific order.

Have fun!
