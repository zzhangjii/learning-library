If you are unsure of the data center you should select, and this is an in-person training event, ***ask your instructor*** which **Region** to select from the drop down list.

As you progress through the workshop, you will remain logged in as a single user, but you will make “logical” changes from Lisa Jones the Project Manager to other personas.
