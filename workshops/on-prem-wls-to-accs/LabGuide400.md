## Introduction

This lab focuses on how to use Oracle Database Cloud Service and Oracle Java Cloud Service to complete the migration of your on-premises Oracle WebLogic Server environment to Oracle Cloud. 
Oracle AppToCloud saves you the tedious and error-prone task of manually migrating all of your existing Oracle WebLogic Server environments to Oracle Cloud. Create an Oracle Java Cloud Service instance that's linked to your existing AppToCloud artifacts in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic, and then perform an import to deploy all of your Java EE applications and resources to the new instance.

- Click on create instance

   ![](images/300/DB/1.png)

- Fill out the details and remember the region.

   ![](images/300/DB/2.png)

- Fill out the details and upload the ssh key. You can create new ssh key if you don't have it already.

   ![](images/300/DB/3.png)

   ![](images/300/DB/3-1.png)

- Click on create and in few minutes new database instance will be running.

   ![](images/300/DB/4.png)

- For this tutorial you do not need Database configurations. If your application needs to connect database, then you remotely connect to the Database Cloud Service instance and use SQL scripts to create the necessary schema, tables and data for the sample application. There are many other ways in which to migrate data to Database Cloud Service.

### **STEP 2**: Create an Oracle Java Cloud Service Instance

- Return to the Dashboard in Oracle Cloud. Locate the Java tile. Click the Action Menu Action Menu Icon, and then select Open Service Console. If this is the first time you have accessed the service then you may be presented with a Welcome screen. If this happens then you can continue to the console by clicking Go to Console.

- Click Create Service and then select the Oracle Java Cloud Service - AppToCloud option.

   ![](images/400/400_2_2_1.png)

- Enter values for these input fields:
  
   ![](images/400/400_2_2_2.png)

    - Exported json File - Enter the fully-qualified URL or the relative path to default_domain.json in the AppToCloud storage container.
For example, SStorage-gse00014412/AppToCloud/base_domain.json
If necessary, refer to the output from the AppToCloud Client tool.
    - Cloud Storage User Name - Enter the name of an Oracle Cloud user that has access to this storage container. This can be the same user that the AppToCloud Client used to upload the JSON file.
    - Cloud Storage Password - Cloud Storage Password
- Click OK

- Enter a unique Service Name for your Oracle Java Cloud Service instance. This tutorial uses the name AlphaProductCatalogWeb.

   ![](images/400/400_2_2_3.png)

- Accept the default values for the remaining fields on the Service page and click Next.

- Click Advanced. Click Edit next to the SSH Public Key field. Use your browser to select the public key file to upload from your local computer. Select the same publicKey file that you downloaded earlier in the tutorial for the Database Cloud Service Instance.

   ![](images/400/400_2_2_5.png)

- Click Enter.

- Complete the WebLogic Access section:
  
   ![](images/400/400_2_2_6.png)

   ![](images/400/400_2_2_9.png)

- On the Confirmation page, review your selections and click Create.
When you return to the Java Cloud Service console, you will see your new service instance listed. It will have a status of "Creating Service".

   ![](images/400/400_2_2_10.png)

- Periodically refresh this page until the service instance creation is completed.

### **STEP 3**: Import Applications into the Service Instance

- Perform an import to update the new service instance with the Java EE applications and other resources collected from your on-premises environment.

- On the Services page click the Menu icon for your new service instance and select AppToCloud Import.
You may need to scroll through the list of menu options.

- When prompted for confirmation, click OK.
Note: After a few moments, the service instance will have a status of "Service Maintenance". Periodically refresh this page until the service instance is no longer in a maintenance state.
If the import fails, use the Activity tab to view the log for this operation.

### **STEP 4**: Test the Imported Application

- Click the name of the service instance.
  
- Identity the Public IP address in this service instance.

- Direct your browser to the URL http://LB_PUBLIC_IP/alpha-office-product-catalog/products.jsp.
Verify that the AlphaProductCatalog application was successfully deployed to Oracle Cloud.
