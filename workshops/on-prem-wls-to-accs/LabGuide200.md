## Introduction

This is the first of several labs that are part of the WebLogic Server On-Prem to Cloud Workshop. This lab will walk you through the process of moving an existing Java On-Prem application into Oracle Application Container Cloud. It will create and deploy war file and deploy it to the Oracle Public Cloud.
