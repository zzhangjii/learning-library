## Oracle GoldenGate Cloud Services Workshop

This Oracle Public Cloud GoldenGate Cloud Services workshop will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle GoldenGate Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around real time data replication and migration.  Three use cases will be covered.  The first will walk you through setting up zero downtime migration with one-way replication between an Oracle 11g database and a DBCS 12c database.  The second lab will show you how to configure GGCS to perform one-way DML and DDL replication between a DBCS 12c database and an on-prem Oracle 11g database.  The third lab is designed to configure GGCS to replicate data between two DBCS 12c Pluggable Databases with data transformations, and show BICS dashboards against replicated data.  Lastly you will review GGCS monitoring services.
