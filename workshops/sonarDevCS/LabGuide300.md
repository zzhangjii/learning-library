## Introduction

Welcome to the Automated Code Inspection workshop. This workshop will walk you through application lifecycle management with embedded code review using SonarQube. It will showcase how SonarQube can save time and improve code quality directly inside the agile development process.

**_To log issues_**, click here to go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/issues/new) repository issue submission form.

## Objectives

- Run the job to see the new analysis in SonarQube.
- Create issue in Developer Cloud Service
- Fix the issue in code
- Close issue in Developer Cloud Service.

## Required Artifacts

For this lab you will need Oracle Cloud account and Developer Cloud service instance.

## Fixing the issue in code
