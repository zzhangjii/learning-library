# Introduction to Python Development with Autonomous Transaction Processing

Welcome to the Introduction to Python Development with Autonomous Transaction Processing Workshop. This workshop will introduce you to the most rapid and advanced full-stack development environment available today.

In the next two hours you will experience a day in the life of Derek McCarthy – a full-stack developer for the fictious company Alpha Office. Derek has been hired to introduce new best practices to Alpha Office microservices developers. In this workshop you will take on Derek’s persona to build a series of three cloud-based microservices database applications. In doing so, you will leverage the latest and most advanced Oracle and open-source technologies.

As Derek, you will spin up a new Oracle Cloud Developer Image from the Oracle Marketplace to quickly and easily deploy a complete development environment that is accessible from any location. You will also deploy the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (Autonomous Transaction Processing) Cloud Service providing the full power of the Oracle database while requiring minimal administrative effort and minimal database knowledge and training.  

Additionally as Derek, you will work within the Oracle Cloud Developer Image to create Python microservices. You will utilize the best open source technologies to complement the Python language, including the Visual Studio Code IDE, the Flask micro web framework, the Bokeh interactive visualization library and the ReactJS Facebook JavaScript library.  

Finally as Derek, you will create a pair of spatial applications. To do this you will utilize the GeoPandas extensions to Python together with Oracle Spatial functionality within the Autonomous Transaction Processing database.
