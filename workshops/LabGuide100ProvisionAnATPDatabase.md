# Lab 100: Provisioning an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Database on Oracle Infrastructure Cloud (OCI). You will provision a new database.

## Objectives

- Learn how to sign-in to the Oracle Public Cloud
- Learn how to provision a new ATP database

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

# Section 1. Provisioning an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database Instance

In this section you will be provisioning an ATP database using the cloud console.

## Steps

### **STEP 1: Sign in to Oracle Cloud**

-   Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com), click **Sign In** to sign in with your Oracle Cloud account.
