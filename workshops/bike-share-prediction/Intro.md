 # Bike Share Demand Prediction Workshop

## Introduction

This is the first of several labs that are part of the **Bike Share Demand Prediction workshop.** This workshop will walk you through the process of using the Autonomous Data Warehouse for storing analytical datasets and applying Machine Learning models in order to learn the correlation between different attributes and predict the future demand.

You will take on 2 Personas during the workshop. The **Data Scientist Persona** will prepare the data for training and validating the machine learning models and apply those models in order to predict the future demand. The **Business Analyst Persona** will also build and apply Machine Learning models using Oracle Analytics Cloud service without writing a single line of code. During the workshop, you will get exposure to Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Machine Learning tool (OML) and Oracle Analytics Cloud Service (OAC).

## Objectives
- Provision an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) Instance
- Transfer Data to the ADW Instance
- Build and Apply Machine Learning Models in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)
- Connect the OAC instance to the ADW instance to access the datasets
- Build Machine Learning models in OAC without writing a single line of code!
- Build and Apply Machine Learning Models Within the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) Instance by using the Oracle Machine Learning Tool (OML)
