  ![](images/050/Title.png)

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop you are guided through using many of the Oracle's Cloud Services to support a transition from a monolithic on-prem environment to a Cloud based microservices environment. The high level flow will be:

- Lab 010: Install VirtualBox on your local machne and import the workshop Client Image
- Lab 050: Provision supporting services (Database, Visual builder Instance).
- Lab 100: Populate your database with seed data.
- Lab 200: Create a Compute Instance and use Docker to deploy a Java based REST application.
- Lab 300: Deploy and explore the REST application into a Kubernetes Cluster.
- Lab 400: Create a Visual Builder mobile application to use the REST endpoints of the Java application.

## Lab 010 Objectives

- Download and install VirtualBox for your operating system
- Download the supporting workshop Client Image and import into VirtualBox
- Startup the Client Image

# VirtualBox Setup

You will create all required infrastructure components that support this workshop. The client image is a pre-created Linux based image that has GIT and SQL Developer already installed. These tools are used in the subsequent workshop labs.
