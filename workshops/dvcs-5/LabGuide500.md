## Lab 500 – Predicting Subscriptions - Machine Learning

Key takeaways from this lab:
- Learning how to create data flows
- Using the **Machine Learning** abilities of OAC

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning, at its most basic, is the usage of algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something. The Machine Learning abilities of OAC allow you to make predictions based on your data set. Data Visualization also provides scripts to train data models that you can add to other data sets to predict trends and patterns in data.

### Scenario

When customers purchase products through a partner, KoolKart would like to include a discount coupon in the shipping confirmation email as an incentive for users to subscribe to the KoolKart mailing list. Now, Isla Stuart, who is a Digital Marketing Specialist, has to understand the customer demographics and figure out how big the incentive should be.

To do this, Isla  has already obtained 4 different data sets: Orders, Customers, Subscriptions and Partner Sales. She wants to look at subscription patterns on the KoolKart website and develop a model that looks at past subscription data to determine how Customer Age Group, Customer Gender, Customer Country and  purchased Product Category influence the likeliness to subscribe.

Isla knows that she needs to use KoolKart Orders and KoolKart Customers data sets together. Most importantly, she decides to utilize the Data Flow functionality of OAC that allows her to create a data set tailored to her needs. Let's start!

### a) Creating a Data Flow for KoolKart Orders and Customers

1. Create a **Data Flow** and add a **Data Set**.

    Download the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/raw/master/workshops/dvcs-5/Exercise%20Files/KoolKart%20Orders.xlsx">**KoolKart Orders.xlsx**</a> file.

    Now, select the hamburger menu button and click on the Home button.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_1_1v2.png)

    Select **Create** and then **Data Flow**.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_1_2.png)

    Select **Create Data Set** to load in the Excel file.

    ![](images/200/img_2a_2_2.png)

    Select **Drop data file here or click to browse** and select the **KoolKart Orders** data set.

    ![](images/200/img_2a_2_3.png)

    Click **Add** to add the **KoolKart Orders** to begin the data flow.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_1_3.png)

2. Once the **Data Flow Editor** opens up, select the **Data Flow Steps** tab.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_2_1.png)

    Download the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/learning-library/raw/master/workshops/dvcs-5/Exercise%20Files/KoolKart%20Customers.xlsx">**KoolKart Customers.xlsx**</a> file.

    Click the **Add Data** icon and drag it to the editor.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_2_2.png)

    Now, add the **KoolKart Customers** file by selecting **Create Data Set**, followed by **Drop data file here or click to browse** and then selecting **Add**, like we did in the previous steps.

    Click on **Join** and add it to the data flow.
    ![](images/500/img_5a_2_3.png)

    Ideally, OAC should detect the joining logic, but in case it doesn't, you will see an Incomplete join message.

    Click on the circle to complete the join.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_2_4v2.png)

    If you've successfully made the join, the dataflow will reflect the image below.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_2_5v2.png)

3. The **Movies & Music** category is not required for the analysis. So, we add a filter to the **Data Flow**.

    Select **Filter** and drag between **KoolKart Orders** and **Join**.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_3_1v2.png)

    Select the **+** and select the category attribute.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_3_2.png)

    Select **Movies & Music** to move it to the **Selections**. Click on the hamburger option, and select **Exclude Selections**.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_3_3.png)

4. Add **Select Columns** to the Data flow and exclude the duplicated **Customer ID**.

    Select **Select Columns** and drag it to **+** on in front of Join.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_4_1v2.png)

    Select **Customer_ID1** and click on **Remove Selected**.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_4_2v2.png)

5. Group Sales data into Regions.

    Select **+** next to **Select Columns** and then select **Group**.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_5_1v2.png)

    Click **Select column** and select **Customer Country**.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_5_1b.png)

    Set the group name to **Sales Region**.
    Then, name the first group **NA** and add **Canada** and **USA** to the group.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_5_2.png)

    Click **+ Group** to add a second group and name it **EMEA**. Add **France**, **United Kingdom**, and **Germany** to the group.

    Click **+ Group** to add a third group and name it **APAC**. Add **Japan** to the group.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_5_3.png)

    Now, drag **Save Data Set** into the editor. Save the data set as **KoolKart Orders & Customers**. Set **Order ID** and **Customer ID** to attributes.

    ![](images/500/img_5a_5_3_2v2.png)

    ![](images/500/img_5a_5_3_3v2.png)

    Save the **Data Flow** by clicking the Save button in the top corner.
