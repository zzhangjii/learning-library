# From files to Object Storage, then to ADWC and OAC                                    

When you need a visualization and want to keep it up with the data source updates, Oracle provides the perfect tools, all you have to do is to link them together. This workshop walks you through all the steps to set up the pipeline. In order to get started, you will need to provision a **Virtual Machine (VM)**, **Oracle Object Storage**, **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)**, **Oracle Autonomous Analytic Cloud Service (OAC)** (or using local **Oracle Data Visualization Desktop (DVD)** free with the purchase of ADW service). Information about how to provision those instances can be found inside upper level workshop folders.

A typical workflow contains 3 steps:
1. Obtain the data from various resources and upload it into object storage, this step can be automated through scheduling a script job in VM;  
2. Load the data from object storage into ADWC, this step can be automated through scheduling a notebook job in ADWC; 
3. Refresh the visualization in OAC or DVD to reflect the data updates in ADWC. 

## Move data from various sources to ADWC

## Loading data to ADWC from object storage

We have already seen in ?? how to provision Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADWC). In this section we will focus on how to get data to ADWC from object storage without any human intervention.


We have already seen how to set up an object storage and load data into it in the previous section. Once the data files are updated in object storage we need to construct the URLs of the files and an object store auth token. Refer Steps 7-9 Under Setup the OCI Object Store (https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/journey4-adwc/?page=LabGuide3.md)


**Prerequisites â€“ Required Software**

Now we go to our ADWC instance service console and go to our ML notebook. If you need help creating an Oracle ML note book please refer to (https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/workshops/journey4-adwc/?page=LabGuide8.md).


## Step 1: Remotely upload data into Oracle Object Storage 
This step walks you through the details of loading data into Oracle Object Storage, and how to set up a scheduler in VM to automate this job.


We have 2 users "ADMIN" and "OMLUSER1". We use the "OMLUSER1" for the further steps. We cannot use "ADMIN" for any of the below steps. 


![](images/OMLusers.png)

Now we run the below script in Oracle ML notebook as OMLUSER1 to load the data automatically from Object Storage to ADWC.

![](images/sqlquery.png)

The data is now loaded in ADWC. We will create a job in our ML notebook to automate this loading process. 
The steps for scheduling a data load to ADWC are shown below.
- Click on Jobs under Quick Actions
   ![](images/mlnotebookhome.png)
   
   
- The job window opens and now click on create
   ![](images/jobshomepage.png)
   
- The job ctreation wizard will pop up. Here you can select the notebook which you can to schedule for an automatic run and also select the frequency of the run. For example here we want our data load job to run every 15 minutes.
    ![](images/jobdetails.png)
      
 Below is our scheduled job
   ![](images/jobdetails2.png)
   
 We can see that out job for automatic data load has ran successfuly every 15 minutes.

## Using the data in Data Visualization desktop
The data we have in ADWC can we used for drawing important business insights and in the below steps we will see how we can use Data Vizualization desktop for the name. You get a free licence for Data Visualization Desktop with Autonomous Data warehouse.

- Learn how to upload data into Oracle Object Storage remotely

**Guide**

1. Create a bucket in Object Storage
Instructions can be found here:   <a href="https://cloudsolutionhubs.github.io/autonomous-database/workshops/?page=LabGuide400LoadingDataToOracleAutonomousDatabase.md" target="_blank">Setup the OCI Object Store</a>
![](images/1-1.png)
Remember to choose "Standard" for storage tier, "Archieve" type won't work for step 2.

2. Obtain "Secret Key" and "Access Key"

To access the Oracle Object Storage from outside, we need to obtain Object Storage's "Secret Access Key" and "Access Key ID" first.
Inside OCI, click through top_left MENU => Find "Identity" under Govonance and Administration => Select "Users" => Click on the user acount to open;
![](images/1-2.png)

In the new page, on the left side, select "Customer Secret Keys" under Resources => Click "Generate Secret Key" => Put in Name => Copy the generated Secret Key and write it down (IMPORTANT! This key will not show again!) => Now, in the main page "Customer Secret Keys" section, click "show" to see the Access Key value.

3. Install rclone tool

Rclone ("rsync for cloud storage") is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from different cloud storage providers.
Detail instructions can be found here: <a href="https://rclone.org" target="_blank">Rclone homepage</a>

Here we use a Virtual Machine on Oracle Cloud as an example to show how to use rclone to make the connection happen:
Inside VM, open a terminal, run the following command to install rclone:

```curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash```

If you encounter any installation problems, you can find help here: <a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Rclone download</a>


4. Set up OCI Object Storage bucket as rclone remote
Inside VM terminal, run rclone config command to set up a remote link:

```rclone config```

![](images/1-4.png)

then enter ```n``` to select "New remote" option.

Following prompt, entering/selecting the following information:
```
name: XXX

type = s3  (Oracle Object Storage is categoried as s3 here)

provider = Other (Oracle is categoried as other)

env_auth = false

access_key_id = enter the access key value in step 2

secret_access_key = enter the secret key value in step 2

region = us-ashburn-1 (select the region in which you created your service, this your_region_identifier can be found in top right region of OCI interface )

endpoint = https://<your_namespace>.compat.objectstorage.<your_region_identifier>.oraclecloud.com (namespace can be found in your object storage bucket information page)

acl = bucket-owner-full-control
```

5. Load data into Object Storage

Once your have set up your rclone remote, you can confirm it with command:

```rclone listremotes```

![](images/1-5.png)

In this example, rclone has a remote name 'oci' linking with our Object Storage. We can use the following command to upload local data into the "Test" bucket inside our Object Storage:

```rclone --verbose --cache-workers 64 --transfers 64 --retries 32    copy   /home/ubuntu/temp_unzip/    oci:Test```

After "copy", the "/home/ubuntu/temp_unzip/" is the path of the source file, "oci:Test" is the target Object Storage bucket, note that if there's no bucket name "Test" in your Object Storage, it will create one with this name to store the files.

![](images/1-6.png)

If files are already in Object Storage bucket, then this copy command will only transfer files that need to be updated.

## Step 2: Automatically load data from Object Storage into ADWC
