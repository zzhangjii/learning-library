# Database Cloud Services Workshop for Oracle Compute Infrastructure (OCI)

Welcome to the Oracle Database Cloud Service Workshop. This particular version is based on Oracle's 'OCI' services, versus Oracle 'Classic' services. These labs will give you a basic understanding of the Oracle Database Cloud Service and many of the capabilities around administration and database management. Lab 100 will introduce you to DBCS and show you how to create a Cloud Database. Lab 200 will cover various data migration use cases, including pluggable database migration, tablespace migration, schema migration, and ad-hoc table copying between databases. Lab 300 covers some common Database management activities. Lab 400 show you how to use the Oracle Command Line Interface (CLI) commands to perform various tasks.  This workshop was built on and for version 12.2 of the database, but will also work with 18c with minor changes.  See the 18c_updates document in the drop down menu.
