- Bookmark the page so that if you need to sign in again, you can navigate directly to the Oracle Data Safe **SIGN IN** page.



## **STEP 3**: View the Oracle Data Safe Dashboard

- Notice that when you sign in to Oracle Data Safe, you are presented with a dashboard on the **Home** tab.

  The dashboard lets you monitor several activities at once.

  When you first sign in, the charts in your dashboard do not contain data because you have not yet used the features.

  They provide quick access to the dashboard (**Home** tab), registered target databases (**Targets** tab), the Oracle Data Safe Library (**Library** tab), reports for all Oracle Data Safe features (**Reports** tab), all of the alerts (**Alerts** tab), and all of the current and scheduled jobs (**Jobs** tab).

- View the side tabs.

  They provide quick access to Oracle Data Safe's main features, including **Security Assessment**, **User Assessment**, **Data Discovery**, **Data Masking**, and **Activity Auditing**.
