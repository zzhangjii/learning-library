## Module 2:  Learn How to Provision a New Autonomous Database

1. Click on the “**Create Autonomous Database**” button, as
shown below:

![](media/f5503ce437deca3784758e841a77bebd.png)
<p align="center">Figure 2-1</p>

2. The following information must be filled in this page:

**Compartment** – This can be changed, to organize and isolate databases

**Display Name –** The name of the service displayed

**Database Name –** The name of the actual database



After filling fields, you will select a workload type and deployment option. Please select Data Warehouse or Transaction Processing.  Then select Serverless or Dedicated.  For our lab, you will select Serverless.


![](media/adb-workload.png)
<p align="center">Figure 2-2</p>

Now continue to enter the following information: 

**CPU Core Count –** Number of CPU’s allocated to the database (min 1)

**Storage –** Storage allocated to database in Terabytes (min 1)

By clicking on **Auto scaling**, the CPUs will autonomatically scale to acomodate the workload.  Please keep default of checked.  

There will be database releases ready for customers to test out upgrades.  19c Preview wull be available for the next few months.  Please do not select this option.

![](media/autoscale-preview.png)
<p align="center">Figure 2-3</p>

**Password –** Database “Admin” user password

**Confirm password –** Re-type Database “Admin” user password

**License Type –** Select whether customer is using existing on-premises
database licenses (BYOL) or requires new licences. Customer charge will be based
on selected option.  Select BYOL

When you click on "Show Advanced Options", you can add tags.  You do not need to add any tags at this time.

**TAGS –** a metadata system that allows you to organize and track resources
within your tenancy. Tags are composed of keys and values that can be attached
to resources.

Click on **Create Autonomous Database** 

You will be placed on the Database Details page and your database will be in
“**Provisioning**” status. The Database Details page displays more information
about your instance, notice the various menu buttons that help you manage your
new instance.

![](media/1865063cdcbea900e9233a4c0a36bc11.png)
<p align="center">Figure 2-4</p>

The status will automatically change to “**Available**” when the database is
ready in a few minutes…Your Autonomous database is up and running! Take notice
of the green color of the ATP logo indicating the service is available and
commands to start, stop, terminate, and scale the service.

<p align="center">Figure 3-1</p>

1. The DB Connection page provides you the ability to download the client credentials and connection information to connect to your database

![](media/adb-dbconnection.png)
<p align="center">Figure 3-2</p>

2. The Performance Hub allows you to view real-time and historical performance data from the Performance Hub. Performance Hub shows Active Session History (ASH) Analytics and SQL Monitoring.

![](media/adb-performancehub-page.png)
<p align="center">Figure 3-3</p>

3.  The **Scale Up/Down** tab provides the ability to turn on/off the auton scale option or change the base CPU and Storage.

![](media/adb-scaleup.png)
<p align="center">Figure 3-4</p>

4. If you want to stop your database, click on the **Stop** tab and confirm to stop the database.

![](media/adb-stop-page.png)
<p align="center">Figure 3-5</p>

5.  The **Actions** pull down provides a number of actions tha can be performned against the database.  These include Restore from backup, Create clone database, update Access Control List, change your Admin Password, Update License Type, Move your database into a different compartment, update associated Tags, or Terminiate the database instance.

![](media/adb-actions-list.png)
<p align="center">Figure 3-6</p>

6.  If you scoll down the page, you will see **Metrics**.  There is a chart for each metric. In each chart you can select the Interval and Statistic or use the default values.  To create an alarm on a metric, click Options and select Create an Alarm on this Query.

7.  If you select **Backups**, you can view backups that have been made for your Autonomous Database.  You Autonomous Database is automatically backed up for you. The retention period for backups is 60 days. You can restore and recover your database to any point-in-time in this retention period.  You can also create *Manual** backups. The manual backups are put in your Cloud Object Storage bucket. When you initiate a point-in-time recovery Autonomous Data Warehouse decides which backup to use for faster recovery.

![](media/adb-backups-page.png)
<p align="center">Figure 3-8</p>

8.  **Work Requests** is an activity log that enables you to track each step in an operation's progress. Each work request has an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) that allows you to interact with it programmatically.
