This image shows the SSH Keys section of the Launch Instance form.

At the top of the image is the SSH Keys section title, followed by two radio
buttons labeled "Choose SSH Key Files" and "Paste SSH Keys" (which is selected). 
Underneath is the public key text field, in which an SSH public key has been 
pasted.
