## Lab Introduction
From the point of view of an application, the PDB is the database, in which applications run unchanged. PDBs can be very rapidly provisioned and a pluggable database is a portable database, which makes it very easy to move around, perhaps for load balancing or migration to the Cloud.

Many PDBs can be plugged into a single Multitenant Container Database or CDB. From the point of view of a DBA, the CDB is the database. Common operations are performed at the level of the CDB enabling the DBA to manage many as one for operations such as upgrade, configuration of high availability, taking backups; but we retain granular control when appropriate. This ability to manage many as one enables tremendous gains in operational efficiency.

Enormous gains in technical efficiency are enabled by a shared technical infrastructure. There’s a single set of background processes and a single, global memory area – the SGA – shared by all the PDBs. The result is that with this architecture we can consolidate more applications per server.

## Setup

### Lab Assumptions
- Each participant has been provided a username and password to the tenancy c4u03.
- Each participant has completed the Environment Setup lab.
- Each participant has created an OCI compute instance using the database template.

There are two container databases running:
- CDB1 running on port 1523
- CDB2 running on port 1524

### Lab Setup

All the scripts for this lab are located in the /u01/app/oracle/labs/multitenant folder.  

1.  To access the scripts, secure shell into the OCI compute instance.

2.  Change to the ssh directory and ssh into your instance.  The public IP address can be found by going to Compute -> Instance.

    ````
    cd .ssh
    ssh -i optionskey opc@<your public ip address>
    ls
    sudo su - oracle
    cd /home/oracle/labs/multitenant
    ````

## Section 7: PDB Hot Clones
This section looks at how to hot clone a pluggable database.

The tasks you will accomplish in this lab are:
- Create a pluggable database **OE** in the container database **CDB1**
- Create a load against the pluggable database **OE**
- Create a hot clone **OE_DEV** in the container database **CDB2** from the pluggable database **OE**

1. Connect to **CDB1**  

    ````
    sqlplus /nolog
    connect sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb1 as sysdba
    ````

2. Create a pluggable database **OE** with an admin user of **SOE**  

    ````
    create pluggable database oe admin user soe identified by soe roles=(dba);
    alter pluggable database oe open;
    alter session set container = oe;
    grant create session, create table to soe;
    alter user soe quota unlimited on system;
    ````

    ![](img/mt/oe.png)

3. Connect as **SOE** and create the **sale_orders** table  

    ````
    connect soe/soe@localhost:1523/oe
    CREATE TABLE sale_orders 
    (ORDER_ID      number, 
    ORDER_DATE    date, 
    CUSTOMER_ID   number);
    ````
 
 4. Open a new terminal window, sudo to the oracle user and execute write-load.sh. Leave this window open and running throughout the rest of the multitenant labs.  

     ````
    sudo su - oracle
    cd /home/oracle/labs/multitenant
    ./write-load.sh
    ````
    Leave this window open and running for the next few labs.

5. Go back to your original terminal window.  Connect to **CDB2** and create the pluggable **OE_DEV** from the database link **oe@cdb1_link**  

    ````
    connect sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba
    create pluggable database oe_dev from oe@cdb1_link;
    alter pluggable database oe_dev open;
    ````

6. Connect as **SOE** to **OE_DEV** and check the number of records in the **sale_orders** table  

    ````
    connect soe/soe@localhost:1524/oe_dev
    select count(*) from sale_orders;
    ````

7. Connect as **SOE** to **OE** and check the number of records in the **sale_orders** table  

    ````
    connect soe/soe@localhost:1523/oe
    select count(*) from sale_orders;
    ````

8. Close and remove the **OE_DEV** pluggable database  

    ````
    connect sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba
    alter pluggable database oe_dev close;
    drop pluggable database oe_dev including datafiles;
    ````

9. Leave the **OE** pluggable database open with the load running against it for the rest of the labs.

You can see that the clone of the pluggable database worked without having to stop the load on the source database. In the next lab you will look at how to refresh a clone.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)


## Section 8: PDB Refresh
This section looks at how to hot clone a pluggable database, open it for read only and then refresh the database.

The tasks you will accomplish in this lab are:
- Leverage the **OE** pluggable database from the previous lab with the load still running against it.
- Create a hot clone **OE_REFRESH**` in the container database **CDB2** from the pluggable database **OE**
- Refresh the **OE_REFRESH**` pluggable database.

1. Connect to **CDB2**  

    ````
    sqlplus /nolog
    connect sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba
    ````

2. Create a pluggable database **OE_REFRESH**` with manual refresh mode from the database link **oe@cdb1_link**  

    ````
    create pluggable database oe_refresh from oe@cdb1_link refresh mode manual;
    alter pluggable database oe_refresh open read only;
    ````

3. Connect as **SOE** to the pluggable database **OE_REFRESH**` and count the number of records in the sale_orders table  

    ````
    conn soe/soe@localhost:1524/oe_refresh
    select count(*) from sale_orders;
    ````

4. Close the pluggable database **OE_REFRESH**` and refresh it from the **OE** pluggable database  

    ````
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1524/oe_refresh as sysdba

    alter pluggable database oe_refresh close;

    alter session set container=oe_refresh;
    alter pluggable database oe_refresh refresh;
    alter pluggable database oe_refresh open read only;
    ````

5. Connect as **SOE** to the pluggable dataabse **OE_REFRESH**` and count the number of records in the **sale_orders** table. You should see the number of records change.  

    ````
    conn soe/soe@localhost:1524/oe_refresh
    select count(*) from sale_orders;
    ````

6. Close and remove the **OE_DEV** pluggable database  

    ````
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba

    alter pluggable database oe_refresh close;
    drop pluggable database oe_refresh including datafiles;
    ````

7. Leave the **OE** pluggable database open with the load running against it for the rest of the labs.

## Section 9: PDB Relocation

This section looks at how to relocate a pluggable database from one container database to another. One important note, either both container databases need to be using the same listener in order for sessions to keep connecting or local and remote listeners need to be setup correctly. For this lab we will change **CDB2** to use the same listener as **CDB1**.

The tasks you will accomplish in this lab are:
- Change **CDB2** to use the same listener as **CDB1**
- Relocate the pluggable database **OE** from **CDB1** to **CDB2** with the load still running
- Once **OE** is open the load should continue working.

1. Change **CDB2** to use the listener **LISTCDB1**  

    ````
    sqlplus /nolog
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1524/cdb2 as sysdba;
    alter system set local_listener='LISTCDB1' scope=both;
    ````

2. Connect to **CDB2** and relocate **OE** using the database link **oe@cdb1_link**  

    ````
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb2 as sysdba;
    create pluggable database oe from oe@cdb1_link relocate;
    alter pluggable database oe open;
    show pdbs
    ````

3. Connect to **CDB1** and see what pluggable databases exist there  

    ````
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb1 as sysdba
    show pdbs
    ````

4. Close and remove the **OE** pluggable database  

    ````
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb2 as sysdba

    alter pluggable database oe close;
    drop pluggable database oe including datafiles;
    ````

5. The load program isn't needed anymore and that window can be closed.

6. If you are going to continue to use this environment you will need to change **CDB2** back to use **LISTCDB2**

    ````
    sqlplus /nolog
    conn sys/oracle@localhost:1523/cdb2 as sysdba;
